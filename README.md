[GO Design Patterns: An Introduction to SOLID](https://hackernoon.com/go-design-patterns-an-introduction-to-solid)

---

Consider that Go is not an Object-Oriented language, but it has some similar features
- Methods: You can define methods on structs, similar to how you define methods on objects
- Interfaces: Go has interfaces, which allow you to define a set of methods that a type must implement. This is a form of polymorphism
- Encapsulation: You can control the visibility of fields and methods using capitalization (exported vs. unexported), providing a form of encapsulation

Go doesn't have
- Classes: Go doesn't have classes. It has structs
- Inheritance: It promotes composition over inheritance

Composition in Go
- Struct embedding: The outer struct will have all the fields and methods of the inner struct. It's like saying "this struct has-a" instead of "this struct is-a"
- Interfaces: Define a set of methods that a type must implement. Allows you to write code that works with any type that implements the interface, regardless of its underlying type. E.g. io.Writer has the Write() method

Benefits of Composition
- Code Reusability: You can reuse existing types to build new ones, avoiding code duplication
- Flexibility: You can easily swap out implementations by using interfaces
- Loose Coupling: Components are less dependent on each other, making it easier to modify or replace them
- Testability: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation

SOLID is an acronym that represents five key principles of object-oriented design in software engineering. These principles are aimed at making software more maintainable, scalable, and flexible. By adhering to SOLID principles, developers can create code that is easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.

Here's a breakdown of each principle:

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Concept: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that each class should have a single responsibility or job within the software system.
Benefits:
Improved code organization and readability.
Easier to maintain and modify individual classes.
Reduced risk of unintended side effects when changes are made.

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Concept: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without altering its existing code.   
Benefits:
Enables extending functionality without introducing bugs in existing code.
Promotes code reusability and maintainability.
Facilitates easier adaptation to changing requirements.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Concept: Objects of a derived class should be substitutable for objects of their base class without altering the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if you have a class (e.g., "Animal") and a subclass (e.g., "Dog"), you should be able to use a "Dog" object wherever an "Animal" object is expected.
Benefits:
Ensures that inheritance is used correctly and consistently.
Prevents unexpected behavior when using subclasses.
Supports polymorphism and code flexibility.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Concept: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces that they don't use. Instead, many specific interfaces are better than one general interface. This means that interfaces should be small and focused on specific sets of related methods.
Benefits:
Reduces dependencies and coupling between classes.
Improves code flexibility and maintainability.
Prevents unnecessary implementations of methods.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Concept: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This means that classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete classes.   
Benefits:
Decouples classes and reduces dependencies.
Increases code reusability and testability.
Makes it easier to change implementations without affecting other parts of the system.
Benefits of SOLID Principles

Maintainability: SOLID principles make code easier to understand, modify, and maintain over time.
Scalability: SOLID principles promote code that can be easily extended and scaled to accommodate new features and requirements.
Flexibility: SOLID principles enable code that is adaptable to changing needs and technologies.
Testability: SOLID principles make it easier to write unit tests for individual classes and components.
Reusability: SOLID principles encourage the creation of reusable code components that can be used in different parts of the system.
In summary, SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that help developers create well-structured, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented software. By following these principles, developers can improve the quality of their code and reduce the risk of introducing bugs and other issues.
